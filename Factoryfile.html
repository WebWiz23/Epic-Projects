  <h1> List of project created</h1>
  <p> So far this is my first and only project. I have a long way to go.<br>
    However i have no doubt i will make it to the mountaintop. This<br>
    present project uses the HTML and CSS as languages.</p>
  <h1> My Background</h1>
  <p> I originally got a degree in political sciences from Skidmore College,in New York.
    Then i decided to be an entrepreneur,to create my own business and run my own things.
    That's why i moved to Seattle. Being aware of my lacuna,i decided that i needed training
    in computers.Still,i have to survive,so i went out to get all kinds of odd jobs while
    keeping my eyes on my ambition of learning computers and web developement.<br>
    Then somewho Epicodus one day popped up on my screen. I closed it. Then it kept popping up.
    I decided to get rid of it by calling the number on the ad. To my surprise i learned that
    there is an institution called Epicodus that trained willing people about web developement at
    a very affordable cost.Twice i tried to get into the program,but time conflict or job schedule
    would stand in the way. When i learned that Epicodus was again providing classes this summer,
    i didn't hesitate. I jumped onboard,despite having limited knowledge about software. I jumped
    onboard reminiscing those words of Bob Marley:" where there is a will,there is a way"</p>
  <h1> Current interests,hobbies</h1>

</ul>
